Learning Path
1. Displaying Text with HTML
  🎯 Why start here?
  HTML is the foundation of the web. Before diving into React, you need to understand how browsers display content using HTML tags. React is essentially a powerful tool that helps you create HTML content dynamically.
  📚 What you'll learn:
  
  Basic HTML tags like <h1>, <div>, <p>
  How browsers render static content
  The relationship between HTML structure and visual output
  Foundation for understanding React's JSX syntax
  
  💡 Key Insight: React components ultimately produce HTML that browsers can understand and display.

2. Adding JavaScript to HTML
  🎯 Why this comes next?
  JavaScript brings interactivity to web pages. Before React automates DOM manipulation, you should understand how JavaScript directly interacts with HTML elements.
  📚 What you'll learn:
  
  DOM (Document Object Model) fundamentals
  Accessing HTML elements with JavaScript
  Dynamically updating content and styles
  Event handling and user interactions
  
  💡 Key Insight: This knowledge helps you appreciate how React simplifies and optimizes DOM manipulation.

3. Using React via CDN
  🌐 What is a CDN?
  A Content Delivery Network is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users from the nearest geographic location, improving load times.
  ✅ Why use React via CDN?
  
  Fastest way to start learning React
  No local installation required
  Perfect for experimentation and demos
  Immediate feedback and learning
  
  ⚠️ When not to use CDN:
  
  Production applications (use npm/yarn instead)
  Projects requiring build optimization
  Applications with complex bundling needs
  
  🔧 Why two libraries?
  
  react: Core library for building components and managing logic
  react-dom: Handles rendering React components to the actual webpage
  
  Both libraries work together to create and display your React applications.

4. React vs ReactDOM
  ⚛️ What is React?
  React is a JavaScript library focused on building reusable user interface components. It provides a declarative way to describe what your UI should look like.
  🌐 What is ReactDOM?
  ReactDOM is the bridge between React components and the actual webpage DOM. It takes your React components and renders them as real HTML elements.
  🔄 The Relationship:
  React Components → ReactDOM → Browser DOM → Visual Output
  💡 Key Distinction:
  
  React = Build and describe UI components
  ReactDOM = Render those components to the webpage
  
  This separation allows React to be used in different environments (web, mobile, server) with different renderers.

5. JavaScript Objects in React
  🗂️ Why objects matter in React?
  Objects are fundamental data structures that React uses extensively for organizing and passing information between components.
  📚 Essential object concepts for React:
  Props: Data passed to components as objects
  State: Internal component data stored as objects
  Event objects: Information about user interactions
  Configuration objects: Settings and options
